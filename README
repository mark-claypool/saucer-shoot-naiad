SAUCER SHOOT, Naiad Version
v1.0

This is a rendition of the Saucer Shoot tutorial for Dragonfly, but
made to work with the Naiad version of Dragonfly.

To compile:

1) Create a library of your Dragonfly Naiad engine.  This can be most
easily done by adding the following recipe to your Makefile:

LIBRARY= libdragonfly.a

$(LIBRARY): $(OBJECTS) Makefile
	ar rcs $(LIBRARY) $(OBJECTS)

Note, OBJECTS are all the .o files that make up your engine.

2) Modify INCPATH and ENG in the enclosed Saucer Shoot Naiad Makefile
to point to your engine.

3) Type "make".  This should build the game.

4) Type "./game" (or "./game.exe" on Cygwin) to run.

5) Controls: Arrows move, Space fires, Enter nukes, 'q' quits       

For a description of the capabilities of this engine, see:

Happy shooting!
